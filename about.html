    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <section class="about-story">
      <p>
        Our journey began in the heart of Africa, where the aroma of simmering stews and the laughter of family gatherings filled our founder’s childhood home. Inspired by generations of passionate cooks, we dreamed of sharing the authentic flavors and vibrant culture of African cuisine with the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2010, that dream became a reality. With a handful of cherished family recipes and a vision to create a welcoming space, we opened our doors to the community. From the very first day, our mission has been to celebrate Africa’s rich culinary heritage—one plate at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, our restaurant is a gathering place for friends, families, and food lovers from all walks of life. We invite you to experience the warmth, hospitality, and unforgettable tastes that have made us a beloved destination. Welcome to our table—where every meal is a celebration!
